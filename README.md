# Poker Project

Welcome to the Poker project! This project provides a comprehensive toolkit for analyzing and playing poker hands.

## Usage

### Testing

To test the checker functions in the `Poker` class with the random-generated test suite:

```bash
python test.py [option]
```

Replace `[option]` with the test suite name defined in the scripts located in the `test` folder. Refer to `test.py` for more information.

### Sandbox

You can experiment with the functions provided by the `Card`, `Poker`, and `Game` classes in a sandbox environment:

```bash
python sandbox.py
```

### Play

(Note: This feature is currently under development.)

While the gameplay functionality is being developed, you can still simulate gameplay by creating multiple players and comparing their hands to calculate probabilities:

```bash
python main.py
```
